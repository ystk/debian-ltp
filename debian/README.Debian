LIMITED SECURITY SUPPORT

This is a test suite, and as such is only intended to be run on
non-production, single user systems. The scripts use various techniques
that are exploitable in a context of potentially malicious local users.

The Debian security team does not support using this package on machines
with untrusted users.
